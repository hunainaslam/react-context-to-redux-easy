## react-context-to-redux-easy

This app is based on the React Context API demo from Wes Bos
which is described in the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLJN4JfniH4
and in GitHub at https://github.com/wesbos/React-Context.

This version uses redux-easy (https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-easy)
instead of the Context API.  Even though it uses Redux, I think the
redux-easy approach is simpler than the Context API.

In particular, check out the code in src/index.js
and src/App.js.

This was created using create-react-app.
It contains some files that it generated
that aren't really needed.
